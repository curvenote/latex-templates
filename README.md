# latex-templates

A community curated collection of Curvenote compatible LaTeX templates.

We're developing a template mini-language based on Jinja that allows us to create templates that can be used with Curvenote articles and notebooks, allowing a Template Creator to:

- control Curvenote's package loading and configuration relative to template specific packages
- define tags that can be used to assign content to specific parts of the template like `abstract` or `appendix`
- expose user options in the Curvenote UI to allow an end user to configure the template on export

The min-language is still in beta but we'll publish a link to docs here soon. In the meantime, if you want to add a template open and issue or let us know on the Curvenote [Community Slack](http://slack.curvenote.dev) and we'll configure it for you!
