  abstract: >
    Phase is a useful underlying property of the analytic trace model of seismic data that can be used as both an interpretation aid and a means to calibrate and check interpretations on a given seismic dataset. We introduce the analytical trace model and demonstrate some of its usages. We provide working code in python for computation of the Hilbert Transform using a robust FFT-based method and explore 2 use cases for such computed quantities. Jupyter notebooks used for computation and generation of the figures are included in this project.
  keypoints:
    - A paper to show off the AGU template
    - This is example content that we have used before
    - And this is the last keypoint, which is the last of the content on the title page
