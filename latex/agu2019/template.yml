      title: Data Availability Statement
      description: |
        AGU requires an Availability Statement for the underlying data needed to understand, evaluate, and build upon the reported research at the time of peer review and publication.
        Additionally, authors should include an Availability Statement for the software that has a significant impact on the research. Details and templates are in the Availability Statement section of the Data & Software for Authors Guidance:
        https://www.agu.org/Publish-with-AGU/Publish/Author-Resources/Data-and-Software-for-Authors#availability
        For physical samples, use the IGSN persistent identifier, see the International Geo Sample Numbers section:

        The Plain Language Summary should be written for a broad audience, including journalists and the science-interested public, that will not have a background in your field.
        A Plain Language Summary is required in GRL, JGR: Planets, JGR: Biogeosciences, JGR: Oceans, G-Cubed, Reviews of Geophysics, and JAMES.

    - id: acknowledgments
      required: false
      description: |
        The acknowledgments must list:
          - A statement that indicates to the reader where the data supporting the conclusions can be obtained (for example, in the references, tables, supporting information, and other databases).
          - All funding sources related to this work from all authors
          - Any real or perceived financial conflicts of interests for any author
          - Other affiliations for any author that may be perceived as having a conflict of interest with respect to the results of this paper.
        It is also the appropriate place to thank colleagues and other contributors.
