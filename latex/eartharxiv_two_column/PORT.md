# Changes made during port

Note: This template is based on the `arxiv_two_column` template. Any changes to that template should be updated here too.
In addition the following porting steps were made:

- Changes bibliography style to `AGU`
- Updated the header to comply with EarthArxiv requirements: "non-peer reviewed EarthArXiv preprint"
  - renamed `preprint.sty` to `eartharxiv.sty`
  - modified header to include the required text
  - modified front page header block to contain the required text
  - simplified link colors
